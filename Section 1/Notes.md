## How does an App Work

How exactly does an app work?

We use apps everyday from  doing important tasks like banking and contacting friends to playing games and watching movies
There are actually very few people who know just exactly how an app actually works.

A phone is simply a miniature computer. when a button on that screen gets tapped, the operating system converts that apparent tap into a location and pressure and informs the app the button was tapped, requiring an action.

As an example:
Button A gets tapped and it should change what is shown on screen, such as the background colour of the app to a new colour.
  
An app is essentially made up of three things:

* ðŸ“± The interface - things such as buttons, images, toggles, sliders. Things that can be interacted with.
* ðŸŽ¬ The Actions - What should happen when the interface is interacted with.
* ðŸ“€ The Data - Data stored in the app or a server that it requires. Such as contacts for a contacts app.

some crucial differences between  a phone and a laptop or computer however are:

* ðŸª« Power draw - phones run off batteries so the power draw of apps is an important consideration
* ðŸ’» Processing Power - as the run off battery mostly they are unable to have high computational power so they will be unable to run high intensity applications or services.

We have to frugal in the resource management of the phone and very deliberate. For this we rely on the Operating system, iOS ðŸ“±.
